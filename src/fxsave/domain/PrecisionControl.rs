/// Precision control determines the precision (64, 53, or 24 bits) of floating-point calculations made by the x87 FPU.
/// The default precision is double extended precision, which uses the full 64-bit significand available with the double extended-precision floating-point format of the x87 FPU data registers.
/// This setting is best suited for most applications, because it allows applications to take full advantage of the maximum precision available with the x87 FPU data registers.
///
/// The double precision and single precision settings reduce the size of the significand to 53 bits and 24 bits, respectively.
/// These settings are provided to support IEEE Standard 754 and to provide compatibility with the specifications of certain existing programming languages.
/// Using these settings nullifies the advantages of the double extended-precision floating-point format's 64-bit significand length.
/// When reduced precision is specified, the rounding of the significand value clears the unused bits on the right to zeros.
///
/// Returns a 2-bit (`u2`) value:-
///
/// * `0b00`: Single Precision (24 bits).
/// * `0b01`: Reserved.
/// * `0b10`: Double Precision (53 bits).
/// * `0b11`: Double Extended Precision (64 bits)
